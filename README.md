Hello my name is Chris and I am going to be working through all of the challenges that can be found over at https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges
I will be starting off with the easy ones and working my way up to the difficult ones.
I will be using HTML/javascript for each of the challenges.
This will get me used to programming in javascript and used to git in hopes of finding a programming job.
